#Logistics Operations SQL Project

This project is a structured SQL portfolio built around a Logistics Operations database.  
It showcases real-world SQL skills across multiple categories, including joins, subqueries, unions, date functions, case expressions, and analytical problem solving.

The project mirrors the structure of advanced SQL learning repositories, but all examples and problems are built entirely on **my own Logistics database schema**.
